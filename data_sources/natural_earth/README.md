## AmBIENCe2ABM/data_sources/natural_earth

Contains country shapefiles for from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/).

The Eurostat NUTS dataset unfortunately doesn't contain data for the entire
intended Mopo project scope, so shapefiles for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BA),
Moldova (MD), and the United Kingdom (UK) had to be obtained from other sources,
namely [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/).

[Natural Earth data is public domain](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/).
Cheers for that!
